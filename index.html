                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>India is the third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases globally, contributing significantly to climate change. In 2020, India's total greenhouse gas emissions were approximately 3.3 billion metric tons of CO2 equivalent. This large amount is largely attributed to rapid industrialization, urbanization, and increased energy demand as the country continues to develop.</p>
                    <p>Key contributors to emissions include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Energy Sector:</strong> Responsible for about 74% of total emissions due to reliance on coal and fossil fuels.</li>
                        <li><strong>Agriculture:</strong> Contributes 18%, primarily through methane emissions from livestock and rice cultivation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Industrial Processes:</strong> Accounts for 7%, mainly from cement production and manufacturing activities.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Despite these challenges, India is committed to reducing its emissions intensity by 33-35% by 2030 from 2005 levels. Additionally, the country aims to increase its share of renewable energy to 50% by 2030, showcasing its commitment to sustainable development and climate action.</p>

                    <p>Greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), exist in trace amounts but play a crucial role in the Earth's climate system. Understanding their abundance helps us grasp their impact on global warming and climate change.</p>
                    <p>Current estimates show that:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Carbon Dioxide:</strong> Approximately 0.04% (400 ppm), largely from human activities such as burning fossil fuels.</li>
                        <li><strong>Methane:</strong> Around 0.0002% (1.9 ppm), primarily emitted from agricultural practices, landfills, and natural gas production.</li>
                        <li><strong>Nitrous Oxide:</strong> Roughly 0.00003% (0.3 ppm), associated with fertilizers and agricultural soil management.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Even small concentrations of these gases can significantly affect the greenhouse effect, leading to temperature increases and climate changes that have far-reaching impacts on ecosystems and human society.</p>

                    <p>The longevity of various greenhouse gases in the atmosphere varies widely and influences their overall impact on climate change. Understanding these lifetimes is crucial for developing effective climate policies.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Carbon Dioxide:</strong> Stays in the atmosphere for hundreds to thousands of years, contributing to long-term warming.</li>
                        <li><strong>Methane:</strong> Has a shorter atmospheric lifetime of about 12 years, but is significantly more effective at trapping heat in the short term.</li>
                        <li><strong>Nitrous Oxide:</strong> Remains for approximately 114 years, also contributing to warming over a longer timeframe.</li>

                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>Carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas emitted through human activities, particularly fossil fuel combustion. Understanding its properties is crucial for assessing its role in climate change.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Colorless and Odorless:</strong> CO2 is not visible to the naked eye and has no smell, making it difficult to detect without specialized equipment.</li>
                        <li><strong>Density:</strong> It is denser than air, which can lead to accumulation in low-lying areas, posing health risks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Heat Absorption:</strong> CO2 effectively absorbs infrared radiation, trapping heat in the atmosphere and contributing to the greenhouse effect.</li>
                        <li><strong>Solubility:</strong> It dissolves in water, leading to the formation of carbonic acid, which contributes to ocean acidification.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These properties make CO2 a critical focus for climate policies aimed at reducing emissions and limiting global warming.</p>

                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>Emission estimates for various economic sectors are critical for understanding the sources of greenhouse gases and prioritizing mitigation efforts. Accurate data collection and analysis enable policymakers to make informed decisions.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Energy Production:</strong> Accounts for 38% of total emissions, mainly from coal, oil, and natural gas combustion.</li>
                        <li><strong>Transportation:</strong> Represents 29% of total emissions, driven by gasoline and diesel use in vehicles.</li>
                        <li><strong>Industry:</strong> Contributes 22% through manufacturing processes and the use of fossil fuels for energy.</li>
                        <li><strong>Agriculture:</strong> Represents 9% of total emissions, particularly from livestock and fertilizer use.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Addressing emissions in these sectors is key to reducing overall greenhouse gas levels and meeting international climate commitments. Collaborative efforts between governments, industries, and communities will be essential in this endeavor.</p>

                    <h3>Energy Sector</h3>
                    <p>The energy sector includes emissions from electricity generation and heating. Key methods for estimation include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Analysis of fuel consumption data, including coal, natural gas, and renewables.</li>
                        <li>Application of emission factors for different fuel types to calculate total emissions.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Waste Sector</h3>
                    <p>The waste sector encompasses emissions from landfills and waste treatment facilities. Estimation methods include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Volume of waste processed annually, taking into account waste composition.</li>
                        <li>Decomposition rates of organic matter in landfills, which emit methane during anaerobic conditions.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Industry Sector</h3>
                    <p>Emissions from manufacturing processes are calculated through:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Production data for specific industries (e.g., cement, steel).</li>
                        <li>Emission factors based on the type of materials and processes used.</li>
